Comparing the three tracking algorithms in OpenCV, KCF, CSRT, and MOSSE were selected for this study
The above experimental data shows that for background changes, dim and changing lighting, 
and objects with deformation, the MOSSE algorithm has a much higher accuracy than the other two algorithms.
The tracking drift is also the smallest, and the processing speed is also the fastest. Compared to CSRT algorithm, 
the accuracy is better, while KCF algorithm has the worst processing effect; The fastest processing speed is still MOSSE, 
and the slowest is CSRT.
